# Simple-16-bit-RISC-processor
Welcome to the repository for my 16-bit RISC processor project, designed and implemented using VHDL for FPGA deployment. This project aims to create a simple yet functional RISC architecture processor, featuring a basic set of arithmetic, logical, and control instructions. The processor is simulated using ModelSim and synthesized for an FPGA board using Quartus II/Vivado.
