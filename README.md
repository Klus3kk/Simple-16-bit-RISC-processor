# Simple-16-bit-RISC-processor
A hardware project implementing a 16-bit RISC processor. The goal is to understand the fundamentals of processor operation at the gate level and gain experience in digital hardware design.
## Features:
* Implementation of a basic RISC instruction set (e.g., arithmetic, logical, bitwise shifts, jumps).
* Interrupt handling.
* Extensibility for additional instructions (e.g., floating-point, SIMD).
## Technologies: 
* Verilog/VHDL,
* FPGA, logic simulators.

**Status: In progress**
